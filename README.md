# Musical-Dance-Floor
(DES310 : IED Course Project)
A euphoric user human-computer interaction experience which literally enables you to dance to your own sound. The room resonates with music produced according to the user movement on the floor.

The project is completely made using the Arduino and Basic Ultrasonic Sensors and some basic libraries to play the sounds.
